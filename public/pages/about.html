    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>The name is potato. jimmy_potato. Yes, I had the lack of foresight to pick this username. No, my real name is not jimmy.</p>
    <p>I'm just some random person on the internet that is allergic to going outside. I don't really use social media or produce content. There's a specific aspect of otaku culture that I'm particularly interested in, and I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out.</p>
    <p>I didn't originally intend on creating a whole website... I originally registered this domain to be used for email. I wasn't really interested in creating a website, but I found out that github pages had free hosting, so I made a really simple webpage. I quickly figured out about neocities and later nekoweb. It seemed pretty cool, so that made me want to have my own website. For the first week I spent all of my free time working on the website. It was pretty fun to do even though I don't really have experience in coding. Hopefully I can keep being active on this website.</p>
